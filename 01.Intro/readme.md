# What is a Github Repository?
A repository, or 'repo' for short, is essentially a home for two things: 
1) All of the files for your research project.
2) All of the revision history for each file.

This is awesome, because it serves as both a backup for your data, as well as a space for collaboration with others that you're working with.

**For this portion of the workshop, I'll give a brief tour of some of my repos. The goal is just to show you why I find them so valuable, and hopefully you'll see how helpful they can be for your research.**

## Here's some basic info about Github repositories that you'll need to know: 

1. Github has a maximum file size of 100 MB. That means this might not be ideal for GIS data, and some other types of data. However, there are workarounds, in terms of keeping everything on the same folder by using [GitIgnore](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/git-desktop/05-ignore/), **OR** using compression techniques. For example, converting models to RData files in R can shrink file sizes by an order of magnitude. More on this later.
2. When you make repos, you have the option to make them private or public, this can be changed later. As the name suggests, private repos are not visible to anyone except you or someone you invite to view it, or allow to 'fork it' (more on that later). 
3. If you want to work on a repo with someone, you can invite them as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). This is great, and makes working on projects with others easy. 

That's pretty much the basics, but there's a lot more too.

There's a lot of sources of information about github, so I don't want to reinvent the wheel. This [site](www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/turorials/what-is-a-git-repository) is a good resource for understanding more about the basic information about what repositories are, as well as beginner, intermediate, and advanced tutorials.
