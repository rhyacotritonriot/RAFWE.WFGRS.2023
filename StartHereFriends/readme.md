# Welcome to the Intro to Github Workshop! 

I'm looking forward to the workshop, and getting y'all started on your journey to **never** losing track of where something is EVER AGAIN. It'll be great, trust me. 

### Before we can truly get started, y'all will need to have done some things first:
1. Make an account on [Github](https://www.github.com)
2. Download and install [Git](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
3. Download and install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

### Optional Flashy Choice

What you're reading right now is a Markdown file called 'readme' in the 'StartHereFriends' folder in the RAFWE.WFGRS.2023 Github Repository. 
The text that you're seeing is written in the Markdown syntax, so it uses Markdown syntax to change headings, bold text, add links, add photos, etc.
If you want to get flashy with your repositories, first you need start calling them 'repos', and then you need to know the syntax, so peruse this [cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) at your leisure!
