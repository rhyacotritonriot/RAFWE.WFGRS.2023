ok, let's pull in those datasets we made
first we'll se the working drive, then load from there
```{r}
setwd("C:/PhD/Git/RAFWE.WFGRS.2023")
load("./compartmentalizedRcoding/datasetcreation/sallysonwood.RData")
```
Ok cool, look at that, our data is ready to go

ok cool, now let's model salamander abundance as a function of DBH
we'll make a simple linear model
```{r}
model <- lm(Sallys ~ DBH)
```

ok this is a very simple model, but of course, we often don't have simple models, we have hella complex ones
so, let's save this model, so we can use another script to actually do some analysis and graphing
```{r}
save(model, file = "./compartmentalizedRcoding/simulatedmodels/model.RData")
```

Ok we're done here, let's move on. But first, let's clear our environment
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
```

Ok close this and let's open the next script.
